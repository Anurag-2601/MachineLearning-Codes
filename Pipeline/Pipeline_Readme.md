# Pipeline 

A Machine Learning Pipeline is an automated sequence of steps—such as preprocessing, feature engineering, scaling, and modeling—that ensures data flows consistently from raw input to final prediction. Pipelines improve code organization, prevent data leakage, and make ML workflows repeatable, efficient, and production-ready.
